                                Changes.txt

The list below shows all significant changes made to the package since the
first beta release.

3/10/16 Version 1.61:

		Fixed bug in BasisExpand[Del[w]]
		Fixed display of Del[w]
		Fixed "shadow symbol" problem with new system symbols
		Fixed bug in BasisExpand[tensor^p]

3/5/16 Version 1.6:

		Fixed protection errors caused by new system symbols in Mathematica 9 & 10.

9/16/11 Version 1.53:

        Fixed protection error caused by new system symbol 
        PermutationOrder.

8/28/06 Version 1.52:

        Added code to correctly handle derivatives of conjugates of 
        math functions.

        Corrected a sign error in CurvToConnRule (which only occurred
        when RiemannConvention was set to SecondUp, the default).
   

6/28/04 Version 1.51:

	Corrected errors introduced by Mathematica version 5.0:
	* It now treats new system symbols (Norm,TensorQ,Variance)
	correctly, so as to avoid protected symbol error messages.
	* Fixed a bug in parenthesization of tensor expressions that
	cropped up in Version 5.

11/12/02 Version 1.37:

	Fixed a bug in Grad[u v, Metric->g]: When u is a 0-tensor,
	the non-default metric was ignored when applying Grad to v.

7/26/02 Version 1.36:

	Fixed a small bug in the evaluation of covariant derivatives 
	of mathematical functions such as Log[u+1][L[i]].        

12/18/00 Version 1.35:

        Fixed a serious mathematical bug in the evaluation of 
        Del[x,Connection->y] (which also affected the use of Del
        with the Metric option, as well as other functions such
        as Div with non-default metrics & connections).  The problem
        was that for a contravariant tensor v, the old version of 
        Ricci interpreted Del[v,Connection->y][L[i],L[j]] as if the
        index of v had been lowered before taking the covariant
        derivative, whereas to be consistent with Ricci's other
        conventions it should have been lowered after.

1/7/00  Version 1.34:

        Minor fixes to allow Ricci to work with Mathematica 4.0:
        Treated Tr as a system symbol, with Protect/Unprotect
        around definitions;
        Replaced Literal by HoldPattern throughout.

6/30/99 Version 1.33:

        Fixed the TangentBundle function so that it always assumes
        $DefaultTangentBundle for "generic" tensors whose bundle
        is denoted "Any".  This allows BasisExpand to work correctly
        with expressions such as Del(Tor.X).

1/2/98 	Version 1.32:  
	
	Fixed bug in parenthesizing output expressions

8/18/97 Version 1.31:  

	Fixed bug inserting indices in Del[x,Connection->c]

2/11/97 Version 1.3:   

	Minor modifications to enable use with Mathematica 3.0.

        * Corrected omission of usage messages from released version.

4/14/95         J. Lee

        * Version 1.2 released.

2/17/95         J. Lee

        * Made tensor simplification functions return Null if called in
          error with no arguments.

12/29/94        J. Lee

        * Corrected DefineConstant[x,Type->Positive]

12/14/94        J. Lee

        * Fixed incorrect handling of Del[x,Metric->g] and Div[x,Metric->g]

        * Rewrote the algorithm for TensorExpand to make it much faster on
          expressions involving many factors.

7/11/94         J. Lee

        * Make DefineRelation omit 1-dimensional bundle indices from the
          list of dummy variables in its Module.       

7/7/94          J. Lee

        * Correct handling of dummy variables in the Module created by
          DefineRule and DefineRelation.

7/1/94          J. Lee 

        * Make Kronecker[L[z1],U[z2]] = 1 for 1-dimensional bundles.

5/31/94         J. Lee

        * Corrected code for Alt and Sym to correctly handle symmetric
          products of tensors on 1-dimensional bundles.

3/23/94         J. Lee

        * Added rules for Conjugate[RiemannTensor], Conjugate[RicciTensor],
          and Conjugate[ScalarCurv].


11/25/93        J. Lee 

        * Fix bug in DefineBundle.m in processing of BasisName.

9/27/93         J. Lee

        * Change all Ricci filenames to have no more than 8 characters, for
          compatibility with DOS.

7/15/93         J. Lee

        * Change DefineRule and DefineRelation so they create a "Module"
          for each rule or relation defined; this prevents conflicts with
          user-defined indices such as i1, i2, etc.

2/25/93         J. Lee

        * Fixed bug in Dot that did not allow use of Mathematica's internal
          Dot function for lists.

        * Fixed bug in DefineBundle that didn't correctly set components of
          the metric on a 1-dimensional bundle to 1 when OrthonormalFrame
          -> True.

        * Made metric components -1 when OrthonormalFrame -> True and
          PositiveDefinite -> False on a 1-dimensional bundle.

2/12/93          J. Lee

        * Fixed bug in InsertIndices that caused incorrect error message
          when wrong number of indices is inserted into a tensor.

8/24/92         J. Lee

        * Version 1.0 released.

8/21/92         J. Lee

        * Added "CurvToConnRule".

        * Added "CommutingFrame" option for DefineBundle.

        * Changed interpretation of Type option for DefineConstant,
          DefineMathFunction, DefineTensor: these functions now accept
          Type->{Positive,Real} etc. instead of Type->PositiveReal.

        * Added "Declare".

        * Eliminated "CorrectVariances", and replaced it with the
          Mode->OneDims option of "CorrectAllVariances".

        * Changes the OneDims->False option of AbsorbMetrics to
          Mode->NoOneDims. 

8/13/92         J. Lee

        * Added "ConnToMetricRule".

        * Made UndefineBundle automatically undefine the Riemann, Ricci,
          and Scalar curvature tensors when undefining a Riemannian tangent
          bundle.

8/12/92         J. Lee

        * Fixed various bugs relating to non-default metrics and
          connections on a direct sum of bundles.

8/8/92          J. Lee

        * Fixed BasisGather so it recognizes both x and -x.  This is
          necessary for expressions like ExtdStar[w] which begin with a
          minus sign.

8/6/92          J. Lee

        * Added rules to compute derivatives of components of inverse
          tensors and inverse metrics in terms of the original tensor or
          metric.

        * Added code to make the inverse of a Hermitian tensor also behave
          as a Hermitian tensor.

7/30/92         J. Lee

        * Added the CommutingFrame option for DefineBundle

7/13/92         J. Lee

        * Corrected sign bug in insertion of indices into RiemannTensor[g]

7/12/92         J. Lee

        * Corrected bug in insertion of indices into Sym[_] and Alt[_]

7/8/92          J. Lee

        * Added code to correctly handle Mma's builtin constants

7/7/92          J. Lee

        * Ricci Version 1.0 Beta 1 released

        This first beta release incorporated numerous changes from previous
        versions, formerly called DG.  The most important were:

        * Change in syntax for DefineRelation and DefineRule: underscores
          no longer used in dummy index names.

        * Name changes: Tprod changed to TProd, Extdstar to ExtdStar, to be
          more consistent with Mathematica's and Ricci's naming
          conventions.

        * Delstar has been replaced by Div, and CovLaplacian has been
          replaced by Laplacian.

        * Many new functions and options added, such as ProductExpand,
          CovDExpand, SuperSimplify, BasisName, OrthonormalFrame,
          ParallelFrame.
